# Issue Triage

Move each issue through a small **state machine**. Every triaged issue carries
exactly **one category role and one state role**:

- **Category:** `bug` (something is broken) · `enhancement` (new feature or improvement)
- **State:** `needs-triage` (awaiting evaluation) · `needs-info` (waiting on the
  reporter) · `ready-for-agent` (fully specified, an AFK agent can take it) ·
  `ready-for-human` (needs human implementation) · `wontfix` (won't be actioned)

These are canonical role names; the actual label strings for a repo may differ —
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md` holds the mapping when present. Run **autonomously**:
there is no maintainer to ask mid-run. Where you'd want direction, either make
the call and apply the label, or post a comment and stop — the async comment *is*
the conversation.

Your job is to **classify the issue and pin down the problem statement** —
clarify what's actually being asked, and ask for missing information when it's
under-specified. You do **not** design or plan the implementation: you have only
read-only context and no deep exploration, so solution design is left to the
downstream build agent, which has full source access.

## 0. Ensure the labels exist

Before applying any label, create the canonical set in a **single** idempotent
`github_ensure_labels` call — pass every row below as one `labels` array
(`{name, color}`). It lists once and creates only the missing ones, so it never
errors on labels that already exist:

| Label | Color | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `bug` | `d73a4a` | category |
| `enhancement` | `a2eeef` | category |
| `needs-triage` | `ededed` | state |
| `needs-info` | `fbca04` | state |
| `ready-for-agent` | `0e8a16` | state |
| `ready-for-human` | `1d76db` | state |
| `wontfix` | `ffffff` | state |
| `duplicate` | `cfd3d7` | dedupe |
| `question` | `d876e3` | question |

If the call is denied (the token lacks the permission), fall back to using
only the labels that already exist on the repo and skip the rest. Done when the
labels you need are present or you've confirmed you can't create them.

## 1. Triage a specific issue

1. **Gather context.** Read the full issue — title, body, comments, existing
   labels, author, dates. Search existing issues for **duplicates** by concept
   (not just keyword). If a `.out-of-scope/` directory exists, read it and note
   any prior rejection this resembles. Done when you know the issue's intent and
   whether it's novel.
2. **Classify the category** — `bug` or `enhancement`. But first, check whether
   the issue is a **question** at all (see below) — questions are neither.
3. **Decide the state and act** (exactly one applies):
   - **Question** (asks for information, an explanation, or a comparison — wants
     an answer, not a code change) → add `question` and **stop**. Do **not**
     write an agent brief or mark it `ready-for-agent`/`ready-for-human` — a
     pure question is not work. (The router normally sends these to the answer
     path before triage runs; this is the safety net for ones that slip
     through, e.g. reopened issues. If you can answer it briefly and factually
     from the repo itself, do so in one short comment; otherwise just label it
     and leave it for the answer path or a human.)
   - **Duplicate** → comment linking the original, add `duplicate`, close.
   - **Already implemented** → comment pointing to where it lives, add `wontfix`,
     close. (Factual — safe to close autonomously.)
   - **Under-specified** (bug without repro, feature without a use case) → add
     `needs-info`, post the [needs-info template](#needs-info-template), stop.
   - **Fully specified and delegatable** → add `ready-for-agent`, post a triage
     summary — the problem statement, not a solution design
     ([references/AGENT-BRIEF.md](references/AGENT-BRIEF.md)).
   - **Needs human implementation** (judgment calls, external access, design
     decisions, manual testing) → add `ready-for-human` with a triage summary
     noting why it can't be delegated.
   - **Looks out of scope** (an enhancement you'd reject) → this is a maintainer
     decision; do **not** auto-close. Add `needs-triage`, post a comment with
     your reasoning (cite any matching `.out-of-scope/` file), and leave it for a
     human.
4. **Apply exactly one category + one state.** When you change an issue's state,
   **remove the superseded state label** (e.g. clear `needs-info` when moving to
   `ready-for-agent`) so the issue never carries two state roles. If the existing
   labels conflict (two state roles you didn't set this run), flag it in a comment
   and don't override — a maintainer may have set them deliberately.

## 1a. Reporter answered or added information

You may be re-triaging an open, pre-build issue because the reporter (or a
maintainer) just commented — answering a `needs-info` request, or adding new
detail, repro steps, or clarification. (Re-triage only fires before any build has
started; once an issue is building, it's out of your hands.)

1. **Re-read the whole thread** — the issue body, existing labels, and *all*
   comments including the newest. Re-assess against the gaps that originally held
   it back.
2. **If the new information resolves the gaps** → move the issue forward per §1
   step 3: remove `needs-info` and add `ready-for-agent` (+ triage summary),
   `ready-for-human`, or `needs-triage` as appropriate.
3. **If it's still under-specified** → keep `needs-info`, but **do not repost the
   full [needs-info template](#needs-info-template)**. Acknowledge what they
   answered and ask only the still-open questions — never duplicate a question
   they've already addressed.

## 2. New unlabelled issues (batch / cron)

For each issue with no triage labels yet, run §1. Default new issues that need
evaluation to `needs-triage`.

## 3. Stale `needs-info`

1. Find issues labelled `needs-info` with no activity for **14+ days**.
2. **Check for a prior bot reminder** with `github_list_issue_comments` — look
   for a `last-light[bot]` comment containing "reminder" / "still need" /
   "closing". **Never post a duplicate reminder.**
3. No reminder yet → post a gentle reminder asking if they still need help.
4. Reminder exists and **30+ days** have passed with no reporter response since →
   close kindly, noting they can reopen.
5. Reminder exists, **< 30 days** since → do nothing.

## Triage Notes

**What we've established so far:**
- point 1

**What we still need from you (@reporter):**
- specific, actionable question 1
```

Questions must be specific and actionable — not "please provide more info".

## Tool usage

GitHub operations via `github_*` MCP tools only — listing, labelling, commenting,
closing, creating labels. Never `gh` CLI, `curl`, or raw HTTP.

## Pitfalls

- Don't close aggressively — when genuinely in doubt, leave it open as `needs-triage`.
- Don't change priority or state on issues a maintainer already triaged.
- Check existing labels before adding — don't duplicate.

## Completion

When you have finished — every target issue classified and labelled, or a
batch/cron scan that confirmed there was nothing new to triage — end your final
message with a single marker line:

```
TRIAGE_COMPLETE: repo=<owner/repo> triaged=<N> labelled=<N> commented=<N>
```

Emit it **only after actually doing the work** with the `github_*` tools (a scan
that legitimately found nothing to do still counts — set the counts to 0). If you
**cannot** triage — the `github_*` tools aren't available, the repo is
inaccessible, or an error you can't recover from — **do not** emit the marker.
Stop and explain what blocked you, so the run is recorded as failed rather than a
silent no-op green.
