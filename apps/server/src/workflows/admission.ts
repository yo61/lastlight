/**
 * Admission controller for the global concurrency cap (issue #172).
 *
 * When `runSimpleWorkflow` creates a run with `status: 'queued'` instead of
 * `status: 'running'` (because `countRunning() >= maxWorkflows`), this
 * controller is responsible for promoting queued runs to running as slots free.
 *
 * Two promotion paths:
 *  1. **Event-driven**: `admitNext()` is called in `dispatchWorkflow`'s
 *     `finally` block so a just-finished run immediately frees its slot.
 *  2. **Periodic sweep**: `setInterval(sweep, sweepIntervalMs)` (default 15 s)
 *     also performs TTL expiry of stale queued runs before admitting.
 *
 * Concurrency safety: `admitRun` is a CAS (`WHERE status = 'queued'`), so
 * only the first caller wins a given row — the event-driven and periodic
 * paths can race safely.
 *
 * Admission reuses `resumeSimpleRun` (from resume.ts): a queued run's stored
 * `context` is identical in shape to what resumeSimpleRun reconstructs from,
 * and the ledger's `shouldRunPhase` will run all phases (none have run yet).
 * This avoids duplicating dispatch plumbing and naturally bypasses the cap
 * (resumes enter `runWorkflow` directly, not the fresh-run gate).
